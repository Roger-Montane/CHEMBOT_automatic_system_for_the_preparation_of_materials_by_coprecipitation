# CHEMBOT: automatic system for the preparation of materials by coprecipitation
This project belongs to my baccaulareate research project (carried out during the summer of 2017 and presented during my last year of high school), in which I designed and built an automatic system for the preparation of materials by coprecipitation. This process can be long and tedious to carry out by a person, and the specialized lab equipment designed for this task can be very expensive. In the PDF file you can find the whole project (previous research, design, construction, calibration of the sensors, code implementation, etc. in Catalan) and you can also find the Arduino file that runs the whole process.
